            This repository <b>("Code - OSS")</b> is where we (Microsoft) develop the

            product together with the community. Not only do we work on 
            code and issues here, we also publish our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap">roadmap</a>,<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Iteration-Plans">monthly iteration plans</a>,
            and our endgame plans. This source code is available to everyone under the

        <p>
            Visual Studio Code is a distribution of the Code - 
            OSS repository with Microsoft-specific customizations
            released under a traditional Microsoft product license.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a code 
            editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. 
            It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding
            support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, 
            and lightweight integration with existing tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features
            and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS,
            and Linux on Visual Studio Code's website. To get the 
            latest releases every day, install the Insiders build. 
        </p>

       </p> 
       <ul>
           <li>For <b><i>Remote - Containers, use the Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...</i></b>command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.</li>

       </ul>
       <p>
            Docker / the Codespace should have at least <b>4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)</b> to run full build. See the development container README for more information.
